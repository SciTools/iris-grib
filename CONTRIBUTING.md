How to contribute
=================

We want Iris and its sister packages (such as iris-grib) to be driven by
the community - your contributions are invaluable to us! This page lists
the guidelines for contributors which will help ease the process of
getting your hard work accepted into iris-grib, and shared back to the world.

Getting started
---------------

1. If you've not already got one, sign up for a
   [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
2. Fork the iris-grib repository, create your new fix/feature branch, and
   start commiting code.
 - The main
   [Iris development guide](http://scitools.org.uk/iris/docs/latest/developers_guide/gitwash/git_development.html)
   has more detail.
3. Remember to add appropriate documentation and tests to supplement any new or changed functionality.


Submitting changes
------------------

1. Read and sign the Contributor Licence Agreement (CLA).
 - See our [governance page](http://scitools.org.uk/governance.html)
   for the CLA and what to do with it.
2. Push your branch to your fork of iris-grib.
3. Submit your pull request.
4. Sit back and wait for the core iris-grib development team to review
   your code.
